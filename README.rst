File System Navigation

A set of command line utilities built on a python library designed to make navigating
the command line easier and more user friendly for beginners.

Want to get to your desktop?  Just type "desktop" on the command line and press return.
Want to get to your home directory?  Just type "home" on the command line and press return.
Want to get to your Dropbox directory?  Just type "home" on the command line and press return.

----------
Installing
----------
If installing on Windows or Cygwin, read the "Notes about Windows Support" section first.

If you are extremely familiar with the command line, read the "Technical Notes and Advanced Users"
section first.

With `pip http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html`_ (recommended):
    pip install fsnav â€“install-option="-install-scripts=/usr/local/bin"

From source:
    Download the latest release from: https://github.com/geowurster/FS_Nav/releases
    Unzip the download
    cd into the unzipped directory
    python run_tests.py --test-src
    python setup.py install --install-scripts=/usr/local/bin

----------------
Navigation Setup
----------------
FS_Nav contains several components:
* fsnav - A python module containing a set of functions for file system navigation
* nav.py - A utility built on fsnav that exposes parts of the overall intended functionality
* fsnav_generator.sh - A shell script that implements the actual intended functionality
* count.py - A utility for quickly counting items on the file system

If you just want to enable the navigation functionality listed in the short description of the
beginning of this readme, execute the following after installation:
    nav.py add_to_profile

Then close your command line window, open another, and execute the following:
    desktop
    pwd

The command line output should be the path to your desktop, and should look like the following:
    $ desktop
    $ pwd
    /Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Desktop
    $

Here's what just happened:
* nav.py edited your command line profile to include a call to fsnav_generator.sh whenever a new
  session starts.
* Every time you open a new command line window, fsnav_generator.sh creates a set of functions
  that can be used to navigate around the file system without having to cd /path/to/directory
* These functions are limited to a specific set of directories, and can be viewed two ways:
    fsnav_generator.sh --functions
    nav.py --codes
  Because the GitHub desktop application installs a command line utility called 'github',
  only nav.py can
  In general the function names are intuitive (eg. 'documents' for your documents directory),
  although a few must be renamed to prevent clashing with other existing command line utilities.

nav.py Utility
--------------
Just calling nav.py will print out a directory path:
    nav.py desktop
This script can't do any directory changing by default, but it can be enabled with back ticks
and a call to 'cd':
    cd `nav.py desktop`
It can also easily be incorporated into shell scripts:
    DESKTOP_DIR=`nav.py desktop`

     easy_install pip
     pip install sphinx

* Do not close the terminal, you are going to need it.

^^^^^^^^^
Windows 7
^^^^^^^^^

* Install `Python 2.7 <http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7/python-2.7.msi>`_
* Install `Python Setuptools <http://pypi.python.org/packages/2.7/s/setuptools/setuptools-0.6c11.win32-py2.7.exe#md5=57e1e64f6b7c7f1d2eddfc9746bbaf20>`_ (a package manager)
* Set PATH environment variable for Python scripts:

  - Right-click *Computer*
  - Click *Properties*
  - Go to the *Advanced system settings* tab
  - Click the *Environment Variables* button
  - From *System Variables*, select *Path*, and click *Edit*
  - Assuming you installed Python to ``C:\Python27`` (the default), add this to the end of *Variable value*::

       ;C:\Python27;C:\Python27\Scripts

* Launch the terminal: Click *Start*, find *Powershell*, click it.
* Install Sphinx by typing the following commands to the terminal. There might be some errors, those should not be a problem (probably)::

     easy_install pip
     pip install sphinx

* Do not close the terminal, you are going to need it.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Debianoid Linux
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Python is installed (Unless you're using a brutally lightweight distro. Probably not ideal for documentation production).
* Install Sphinx by typing the following commands to the terminal::

     sudo apt-get install python-pip
     sudo pip install sphinx


--------------------------
Creating the documentation
--------------------------

* Now, still in the terminal, create a directory for your documentation and move there.

  Windows XP::

     md mydoc
     cd mydoc

  Win7/Linux::

     mkdir mydoc
     cd mydoc

* And finally generate a basic documentation template::

     sphinx-quickstart

* Quickstart will ask you some questions.
  The only questions that should interest you for now are:

  - *Project name:*
  - *Author name:*
  - *Project version*

  You can skip the others by pressing Enter.
  This will set up default settings.

  You can change any of these options later (you will be changing at least the version as your project develops).

* This created a documentation source directory.
  Important files in this directory:

  ===============  =======================================================================
  Directory        Contents
  ===============  =======================================================================
  ``conf.py``      Documentation configuration file.
  ``index.rst``    Documentation master file.
  ``Makefile``     Make file to generate documentation on Linux/Unix.
  ``make.bat``     Batch file to generate documentation on Windows.
  ===============  =======================================================================

* The master document, ``index.rst``, serves as a table of contents and
  welcome page for the documentation.

  It contains a heading, table of contents, and a section called
  *Indices and Tables* with references for module index, search and so on.

  You probably won't need the *Indices and Tables* section for now, so I
  recommend to remove it. (This section is added with Python documentation
  in mind - getting module index and search to work for non-Python documentation
  would need some googling.)


  reStructuredText depends on indentation. For example,
  below, each entry in the table of contents has the same indentation.
  This is always **3 spaces**, no tabs. Less or more might work, or it might not.

  By default, the table of contents should look like this::

     Contents:

     .. toctree::
       :maxdepth: 2

  You can add documents to the table of contents like this::

     Contents:

     .. toctree::
       :maxdepth: 2

       tutorial

  ``tutorial`` refers to a document called ``tutorial.rst`` in the documentation directory.

  Example table of contents from a real project::

     Tutorials:

     .. toctree::
        :maxdepth: 2

        tutorials/getting_started
        tutorials/custom_types
        tutorials/yaml_syntax

     Articles:

     .. toctree::
        :maxdepth: 2

        articles/spec_differences

  Here we see documents in subdirectories of the documentation directory.


* Now create some content.

  Create a new reStructuredText file, for example ``example.rst``, in the documentation directory.
  Add it to table of contents (add ``example`` to ``toctree`` in ``index.rst``.)

  Open the file in any text editor (MS Word is not a text editor).
  When saving the file, **make sure** to use the UTF-8 encoding.

  Use `source code of this tutorial <https://raw.github.com/kiith-sa/reStructuredText-tutorial/master/README.rst>`_
  as a reference.

  Use ``Ctrl-C`` and ``Ctrl-V`` . Do random stuff to try what does what.


  For example you can do this:

  * Text::

       An extremely awesome sentence. Another mega-awesome sentence.
       Lines that are together form a paragraph.

       Lines that are apart form separate paragraphs.

  * *emphasized text* : ``*emphasized text*``
  * **strong text**   : ``**strong text*``
  * ``literal text``  ::

     ``literal text``

  * `A link <http://www.google.com>`_ : ::

     `A link <http://www.google.com>`_

  * A code block (note the empty line and **3 spaces** of indentation)::

       A code block::

          print "Hello World!"

  * Headings::

       Level 1
       =======

       ===================================================
       This is level 1 too, but looks better in plain text
       ===================================================

       Level 2
       -------

       Level 3
       ^^^^^^^

       Level 4
       """""""

  * An image: ``.. image:: image.png``

  * Bullet lists::

       * this is
       * a list

         * with a nested list
         * and some subitems

       * and here the parent list continues

  * Numbered lists::

       1. This is a numbered list.
       2. It has two items too.

  * Can be automatically numbered::

       #. This is a numbered list.
       #. It has two items too.

  * Tables::

       ====== ============ =======
       No.    Availability Name
       ====== ============ =======
       1      N/A          Biros
       2      42           piskoty
       3      N/A          beton
       ====== ============ =======

  * Comments::

       .. my awesome comment

  * Citations (the citation itself must be at the end of file)::

       Here is a citation reference: [CIT2002]_.

       .. [CIT2002] This is the citation.

  For more stuff, see the `reStructuredText Primer <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/rest.html>`_ .


* Now generate the documentation.

  WinXP/Win7::

     .\make html

  Linux::

     make html

  This will generate the documentation in HTML format. To find out what other formats
  are available, use make with no arguments:

  WinXP/Win7::

     .\make

  Linux::

     make

  Among others, there should be HTML, LaTeX, Windows HTML Help (chm), man, and so on.

  The generated documentation will be found in the ``_build`` directory, each format
  in its own subdirectory (e.g. ``_build/html`` for HTML).


-------------------------------------------------------------
Some extra features interesting for programming documentation
-------------------------------------------------------------

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Source code highlighting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``code-block`` directive can be used to highlight source code.
Just about any language is supported. E.g. ``c`` for C, ``cpp`` for C++,
``java`` for Java, also ``python``, ``ruby``, ``yaml``, ``xml``, etc, etc...

Example highighing D source code where we also use ``:linenos:`` to
get line numbers and ``:emphasize-lines:`` to emphasize lines 1, 2 and 4::

   .. code-block:: d
      :linenos:
      :emphasize-lines: 1,2,4

      import std.stdio;
      import yaml;

      void main()
      {
          //Read the input.
          Node root = Loader("input.yaml").load();

          //Display the data read.
          foreach(string word; root["Hello World"])
          {
              writeln(word);
          }
          writeln("The answer is ", root["Answer"].as!int);

          //Dump the loaded document to output.yaml.
          Dumper("output.yaml").dump(root);
      }

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Cross-file links
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sections can be labelled by labels in format ``.. _LABELNAME:``,
where LABELNAME is the name of your label (duh).

They can be referenced like this: ``:ref:`LABELNAME``` .

Example::

   .. _the-awesome-section:

   This Section is Awesome
   -----------------------

   This text is awesomely recursive: :ref:`the-awesome-section`


This works even across different files.

This is better than plain links because it works even if files get renamed.
